The Suda service Listens on a TCP/IP port for client requests
that send digitally signed commands to the shell with elevated privileges.
This allows web services to securely execute commands on the shell without
having to run the web server with corresponding system privileges.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// startCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// startCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
